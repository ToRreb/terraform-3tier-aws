🌐 AWS 3-Tier Architecture with Terraform

Welcome! This project demonstrates my ability to design and provision a scalable, production-style 3-tier architecture on AWS using Terraform infrastructure as code from the ground up.

🏗️ What's Included

    Custom VPC with public and private subnets across multiple availability zones

    EC2 Instances for the web (React frontend) and app (Node.js backend) layers

    Aurora MySQL Cluster in the database layer for high availability and fault tolerance

    IAM Roles, Security Groups, and Route Tables to secure and control traffic flow

    Remote state management and Terraform modules for clean, reusable code

🚧 Current Status

The infrastructure is fully deployed. I’m currently wrapping up:

    Final app deployment with PM2 process manager

    Secure file uploads to S3 from the web tier

🤝 Why This Project?

I built this project to go beyond tutorials and really think through what a reliable, secure, and scalable environment should look like, the kind you'd use in production. It reflects my hands-on experience and my mindset for designing cloud solutions that follow AWS best practices.
